		<p> It should come as no surprise that we humans, as rational as we love to proclaim ourselves, are governed by habits and instincts just as any other animal. Our whims and dispositions, artifacts of our well designed inhabitance of nature, remain as inseparable assets of ours as our arms and hands. But poor foolish humanity, whose recently grown legs propel itself forward in increasingly frightening leaps and bounds, can have no certainty that its instincts represent any sort of survival in the brave new world. Humanity continues along its path with the same tendencies that propel every part of the living kingdoms, but now finds itself veering off course, propelled with power proportionate only to its increasing uncertainty and bewilderment. It now bucks about wildly, like a frantic horse. </p>

		<p> When we proclaimed ourselves exempt from the natural law by abstracting ourselves from nature and pretending to exist above it, we blissfully ignored that we have embarked on the greatest challenge we could ever face; a lawless existence is delusion, just as as garden without tending becomes a jungle once again, and by refusing the normal laws of nature, we set it upon ourselves to create new ones. We slowly construed a new direction, a direction suited for beings who could answer to callings greater than they had evolved for. A world where primal instincts become subordinate to moral law, where individual existence could achieve meaning and beauty like a starry sky. It's quite a shame that society, feigning to be advancing in this direction, in reality finds itself drifting, drifting with the winds that used to propel us to survival and happiness but now edge us closer to danger, closer to the danger that we begot on ourselves when we set out on the quest to create our own nature. What a sad, confused world. </p>

		<p> And now, by the same primal tendencies that used to allow us to survive, we have been led astray. Sickly deprived of our nature, our masses fumble through new and alien experiences, our instinct as relevant as that of a lamb in a slaughterhouse. It seems unlikely that mankind as we know it can expect anything but as devastating a crash as inevitably faces a poorly designed element of a natural system. Where is the butcher? </p>
